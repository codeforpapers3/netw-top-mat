Formalization of Network Topology Matrices

- This repository contains a library for the network topology matrices using Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.
- It can be used for to analyze network systems that represented by the directed graphs
  using network topology matrices, including the incidence, loop and cutset matrices.

- The order for running the files:
  1- Matrix_Vector_Auixilary.thy
  2- Network_Incidence_System.thy
  3- Incidence_Matrix.thy
  4- Application_Incidence.thy
  5- Network_Loop_System.thy
  6- Loop_Matrix.thy
  7- Application_Loop.thy
